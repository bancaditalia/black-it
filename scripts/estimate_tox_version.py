r"""Read the output of `poetry export --only=dev --without-hashes` and return the tox version.

The export format is similar to:
    tox==4.18.1 ; python_version >= "3.9" and python_version < "3.13"
    ....

The following two commands should be equivalent:
    poetry export --only=dev --without-hashes | ./estimate_tox_version.py
    poetry export --only=dev --without-hashes | grep tox | head -n 1 | sed --regexp-extended 's/^tox==(.*) *;.*$/\1/g'
